# Enews-Express-project
E-news Express, an online news portal is looking to to expand their business by acquiring new
 subscribers and their design team has researched and created a new landing page which has a
 new outline and more relevant content shown compared to the old page. An experiment was
 further conducted on two randomly selected groups to monitor the interaction of these users
 with the new landing page and old existing landing page.
